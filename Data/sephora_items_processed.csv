Would not purchase again.', 'I like the performance and slight grit in texture but I will say that it does sting slightly.', 'I personally love it. As someone with sensitive skin and acne scars, it has significantly reduced the redness in my face! It doesn’t sting my face like other comments have mentioned. However, I only use it in the mornings. Vitamin C can be harsh on the body in the first place. \nIf you do really rub it in, it turns almost into an exfoliate which is not good to do everyday.

I noticed a slight difference in skin brightness so it works, but there's pilling and it stings a little- especially at first. \nI developed some rashes but I am not sure if it's the vit C or something else. I've read that this is a high concentration of Vit C and may not suit everyone, especially dry skin like mine. but I've never had a reaction to anything ever."", 'I have been using this product for about 2 years and it is awesome!  I know everyone complains about the grittiness but if you mix with a drop or 2 of the ordinary resveratrol + ferulic and emulsify between your fingers it basically gets rid of the grittiness!  Also this emulsion is a close dupe for a very pricey ( I won’t name the brand) vit C serum that is &gt; $160.00 for a tiny bottle with a dropper so it is less stable!!!!!', 'Gritty texture, and stings the skin. It doesn’t sit well on the skin and I could only use if I do not have to go outside', 'Turns hands orange. Once hands are orange they are orange for a week. Not cool', 'The texture surprised me a bit. The HA spheres make it feel like an exfoliant, so if you have sensitive skin it might feel a bit abrasive and does sting a little. However it truly makes my skin GLOW. My skin tone always looks more even and dewy when I wear this.', 'It’s so oily that I had to rinse it out after 20min. Still, it caused breakouts on my chin and forehead\n.', 'I find that trying to rub product in it balls up on your skin. Can’t even add a moisturizer on top.

Also, with just a bit of the product for a few seconds, the skin burned as if the face was on fire. I already use vitamin C on my face and have never had a reaction to the products.', 'Yes, it’s going to feel gritty bc it’s a “suspension”. Read about what that actually means. \nSo, I’ve used many different vitamin c serums with different results. I love this one because it does not make my skin oily, it doesn’t stink, and it truly works. I believe it’s best used after the glycolic acid toner. Both vit c serums do feel tingly for a few min, this is normal. My skin is now even toned, I go makeup free quite often, and it’s so smooth - awesome for makeup application! LOVE IT', ""It works great!! it burns a bit when you first put it on until you get used to it. it has a gritty texture. if either of those bother you Sephora offers a less intense vitamin c cream and it isn't gritty. this one has the best effect though as it is stronger. watching the video about it here is VERY informative and I absolutely recommend. I put it on my face twice a week at night before bed. and then wash it off in the morning. start off doing it once a week until your face gets used to it. it does have a bit of a smell like old pennies but you get used to it."", 'Honestly, I love this product, and it works amazing for my acne scars/hyperpigmentation, I notice when I use it I have this dewy glow! BUT - no matter what I do, this product somehow always leaves my nails stained this disgusting yellow colour (oxidization). Ive tried washing my hands, using something else to apply the product, gloves, nothing works. This makes my face a bit itchy and tingly, so I touch my face often, hence the yellow nails.

BUT the magic happens once it’s had a chance to absorb for a few moments. My skin felt SO soft and silky. It somehow manages to make your face feel moisturized but somehow super soft like a rose petal. It leaves zero film, tackiness or stickiness. I love that it’s oil-free and doesn’t make me breakout but I feel like my skin is drinking it up. I use an extra dab around my eyes for extra hydration as most other facial moisturizers make the skin around my eyes sensitive and burn.

I have acne prone, oily, discoloration, along with acne scarring. To be honest I was very hesitant to use this oil when I first recieved it because I'm very oily to begin with and don't use oils too often, but boy was I wrong. This beautiful oil-serum literally melts right into your skin within minutes! Not to mention has given me such a beautiful glow that lasts all day. It did not irritate my skin at all whatsoever either. It has dramatically improved my scarring and discoloration!

I’m still waiting to see what the long term results will be but I’m very happy so far!', 'This is a great product for people just entering the world of active ingredients. It can be very overwhelming choosing a retinol serum and they can irritate your skin. However, this product has soothing ingredients that help your skin adjust. I use this on my face and even add a few drops to my body moisturizer. It’s so easy to use!', 'I had the opportunity to try this product for free. This was a good product for a beginner. However it isn’t my first choice for someone with more experience with retinoids. It also isn’t the best for oily/ combination skin types. It is a light weight oil but it feels a bit greasy and doesn’t absorb in the skin completely like some of the competitors.

Second time, I woke up with one or two little white bumps under one of my eyes.. It ended up going away and It didn’t happen again but this still didn’t end up being anything special. Used it for quite a few weeks-to at least a month and a half. Only helped the darkness the tiniest tiniest amount. And this is kind of thick too, I got a sample size and had to warm it up with my finger before applying. No strong smell or anything.

My skin felt lighter and cleaner, it was moisturized even though it is the middle of winter. I have been on accutane and it did not irritate my skin. it is also scentless which I like.

I bought it to try and I expected to love it because I love YTTP but I wish I would’ve bought the sample/mini size. Overall, it’s great for VERY DRY skin. It was a little too heavy for me, a bit of thick formula but it’s GREAT for VERY DRY skin. A little also goes a long way.', 'Docking one star because this comes with no seal on it and the last jar I got had dried product on the outside of the lid. Not being able to account for any kind of safety (and getting a new jar with dry crusty product on it) is awful. \n\nThat said, I’ve used this moisturizer off and on for a while and it’s now a permanent part of my routine. I have sensitive (can’t use any silicones or most fragrance), blemish-prone, dehydrated combination skin. I focus my routine around hydration, anti-aging, and blemish prevention, and I’ve also been slowly trying to find places in my routine to cut both unnecessary steps and unnecessary cost. \n\nI have a lot of affordable serums/and cleansers I love, but I recently took a break from buying this and tried a less expensive moisturizer with fantastic ingredients. My skin looked duller. I wasn’t having reactive breakouts but I was getting occasional blemishes and texture. It wasn’t unheard of for me but it didn’t look great.\n\nI’ve been back on the Adaptogen moisturizer for a week and I just went to put on foundation for a zoom meeting and realized I didn’t need it. My skin is even and glowy, I don’t have a single blemish, and my dehydration lines are plumped out (I was marveling at my smooth forehead in the Zoom screen). I knew this product was good for my skin, but seeing the difference after not using it has sold me. The price is fair for how well it works and it’s an investment I’m happy to make- I just wish they’d put a safety seal for consumers on it.\n\nTexture-wise, this is a little thick but isn’t heavy or greasy.

I have combo/sensitive skin and this works really well at keeping me moisturized, keeping my skin barrier intact especially during the winter time. It also moisturizes without making your skin greasy. You can use it year round but I would just use less product during the summertime. It makes your face feel so nice and soft. \n\nPersonal opinion: I don’t necessarily agree with it being advertised as dry/normal skin. Contrary to this, I think it works well for my combo  (dry/oily/sensitive) skin. \n\nA little goes a long with this moisturizer. It also reduced my redness significantly. The only critique I have is that it is falsely advertised as 60ml when the jar says 59ml lol. But overall, nothing has helped my skin more than this product and my skin loves it.', 'Very disappointed with the mini version. There was barely any product in the jar. It was very thick and dried out unlike their full size, which I absolutely loved. The consistency in their 59ml jar is very lightweight, great for sensitive combo skin and a little goes a long way with this moisturizer. Not sure if I just got a really bad batch for the mini version.', 'almost laughed when I opened this. the jar isn’t even half full. will definitely be returning.', 'Moisturizing and moisturizing. If I had to choose between this and hydrate and glow I would choose both. This works amazing in daytime underneath make-up (I use mufe and nars). It feels thick but dries into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling. Really great daytime moisturizer.', ""There's something wrong with the mini version, the one I received was only ~30% filled and a super dark brown color. It seems like the seal is not glued properly and so a lot of the moisture evaporated. From what I've seen of other reviews this has been happening for a while - I would not recommend buying it until they get rid of this batch. I did return it in store and bought a full size instead (they didn't have the mini size in store) and the checkout person was shocked at the condition of it.\n\nProduct itself is wonderful. It has an interesting texture where it doesn't feel thick but is very hydrating and works well even in the cold winters of Toronto. A little goes a long way. But it does break me out around my T zone, so I use a much lighter moisturizer overall and apply this around my cheeks and dryer spots.

PS I have regular skin type (over 50).', 'I should have known that this was not appropriate for normal/dry skin types. I\'m usually skeptical of any product that claims to be ""for all skin types"" since the requirements of someone with oily skin versus dry skin vary dramatically. Nevertheless, I picked this up after trying it out for a few days when I received a deluxe sample. Fast forward to a week of use- and I found myself waking up with my skin hurting and feeling so tight because the moisture in this is just not sufficient for someone with dry skin (for context, I used this with the farmacy HA plumping serum and a paula\'s choice oil on top).\nIf you have oily skin I think this would be a good choice because it is pretty mattifying and dries quickly, but it is truly not made for people who have normal/dry skin.

The texture of the moisturizer was lightweight and non-greasy.  The moisturizer wasn’t too thick at all.  I believe that it would be comfortable for cold and hot days, since it’s not too thick.  Personally, this gel moisturizer didn’t cause any redness or irritation, and it didn’t leave a sticky or tackiness residue on my face.  Overall, I believe that this product, the Origins Ginzing Oil-Free Energy Boosting Gel Moisturizer, would be perfect for all skin types.  All in all, I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends.', ""I have been using this for almost a week and so far, my skin likes it.

Now the product line has presented this in it's place. And it. Is. Terrible. \n\n1. Starting with the application, I find using this open tub less sanitary than the previous moisturizer that came in a pump. \n2. Next, the SMELL! I cannot stand it on my face. It's like rotting seaweed. The ingredients say there is fragrance added...which means this odor is intentional!? \n3. I have oily acne prone skin, so I appreciated the mattifying and pore-tightening effect of the Counter Balance. This product does not claim to be mattifying, so fair enough, it certainly isn't. It does not provide a good base for my makeup and I'm greasy within an hour of washing my face and applying this. My pores remain unchanged. And I've only been using it a week, so I have yet to see if it makes me break out, but I will definitely be returning it before I wait to find out. \n\nThis is unfortunate as I am a huge proponent of Ole Henriksen's products.

I bought this for that reason and because i also get occasional small breakouts on my cheeks. Usually i love ole products but this one is not doing it for me. I do like that it absorbs quickly and the texture is nice but the one drawback that seems to outweigh all the positives is that the cooling sensation is wayyy too intense for me and lasts for over an hour after application. The best way to describe it is that it feels extremely minty (not in a good way). I feel like im not able to use it often enough for it to help with the things its supposed to help with (acne, pores, etc). I should have returned it after i bought it but now im stuck with it and just trying to get through it by using it 1-2 times a week at most.', 'I have been trying some different face creams lately.

The skin around my eyes can get extremely painfully dry and damaged, but ever since I started using this about a year ago, I have never had that problem since! I have used many eye creams, and almost all of them don't help the problem, in fact many make it worse.  This oil however, I used the tinest little droplet rub it between two fingers and apply to my eyes, and my eyes are so hydrated and healthy and not irritated and not dry! It isn't greasy either which is the best part because I really love doing makeup and bright eyeshadows and such, and this does not effect my eye makeup at all. I've been using the same bottle for a year now, with still TONS of product left with twice a day use. I highly recommend this. Its the best bang for my buck and just works wonders on my skin! I highly recommend especially if you have any possible dry patches anywhere or just a very dry face overall."", 'Nice and light. Doesn’t weigh my skin down.

However, even we down here in Texas get hard, cold winters at times... and 2020-2021 was definitely rough. My face got dry, and my friend suggested I try this Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil. Let me tell you - it\'s AMAZING. Just the right amount of moisture (that my skin always is ready to soak up in the cooler months!), and doesn\'t leave that oily feeling that other facial oils does. I\'m a fan for life!', 'I hate to say “holy grail” but my god it’s a holy grail for my sensitive parched skin. A few drops go a long way and leave me glowing in the morning when I wake up. Must have!', 'This is so light weight, hydrating and reasonably priced for what it does.  Has a light marula scent.  I think it\'s comparable to much more expensive brands in the way of facial oils like the Sisley Paris Rose Oil.  You will need to use it in conjunction with a good moisturizer, as it doesn\'t really work on it\'s own.  It can also be used in multiple ways.  Use it over the top of a moisturizer as part of a skincare routine, add it over the top of a tinted moisturizer or foundation for a dewy, ""glass skin"" look, or one of my favorite ways to use it is on the dry chapped skin on my elbows.', 'I am a huge fan of this oil! It’s super hydrating and gives your skin the most gorgeous glow without looking oily. It absorbs beautifully and perfect for my morning routine. I am extremely acne prone and this doesn’t break me out at all! There’s no smell either so that’s perfect for those who are sensitive to scents. I’ve also noticed a huge reduction in the redness on my skin. It feels so soothed now.

As you can imagine, the struggle of keeping my skin under control (especially under a mask) is REAL! As a result, I have purchased numerous moisturizers over the years that have all supposedly been for oily skin. They have all been a complete failure. I also have an extensive skincare routine using aha/bhas, vitamin c, and retinol. So I really dont want my moisturizer to do double duty by having active ingredients in the formula- which has been quite a challenge. This moisturizer has changed the game! Truly a moisturizer that is trying to serve the group it was made for- oily folks! Too many moisturizers that claim to be for oily skin are actually trying to suit multiple skin types (I get it, companies make more money that way). I have no idea how this company made this magic happen, but my search is over. If you have oily skin and are looking for a basic moisturizer without actives, THIS IS IT! With all that being said, if you have dry/normal skin you should skip this and use something more appropriate for your skin type.', ""I like the consistency of the product, it feels as it's described which I appreciate, a lightweight gel mosturizer, it does the job and doesn't feel heavy on the skin.

Has anyone else noticed a change?', 'I don’t understand why this product is so expensive for what it is. If it actually worked, maybe. For my particular skin type (combination, sensitive, acne prone) it made my face extremely red, didn’t absorb whatsoever (I tried using 4 drops and then I tried using 1 drop - didn’t make a difference) and it actually made me break out (I’m on an acne medication and I haven’t broken out in a while) so that was new for me. Keep in mind that it’s different for everyones skin, so it may work for others!\nI suggest trying out the mini size first before dropping $68 on this oil.', 'I love this stuff!

I love skincare but this one really stings the wallet. That’s my negative, on the positive- I adore this oil. It has a light smell and it absorbs easy, I have even used makeup after and it doesn’t clump or get streaky.  I usually use it at night and sometimes in the morning before my Paula’s Choice SPF moisturizer. If I’m not going outside, I’ll use it on its own.

Had to return and will never purchase again!', ""I normally love Caudalie, but this has been such a disappointment. The no.1 functional rule of moisturizers is: day creams are absorbent and able to be worn under makeup, night creams sit on the skin to last the whole night  - this moisturizer feels more like a night cream. It does not absorb at all and it pills incredibly easily - don't even think of trying to put your foundation on 20 minutes after applying it in the morning, it will become disgusting (I literally had to wash my makeup off, and this happened with primers and other foundations too). When I have worn it all day with light makeup on top (quality products, Chanel/Shiseido), my skin has looked awful by day's end - greasy and peeling. \nSo, I've relegated this to night cream territory, but even then it's not my favourite as it doesn't play well with other creams - once again, it pills. \nI was so excited about this cream and it was a splurge for a day cream that was earned by my love of other Caudalie products, but it does not live up to that standard. It does have some of those same lovely qualities - lovely scent and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. However, the negative far outweighs these benefits. I'd like to see Caudalie refine their Resvertrol range so it absorbs properly.\n\n(Side note - it's interesting how these products have so many promotional reviews and the few verified reviews of Resveratrol products often bring up the pilling and greasiness. Hmm.)"", 'I received this product complimentary from BzzAgent. I love Caudalie products in general. I’ve used this creme a few times but I haven’t seen any results thus far.

Alas, everything is not going to work for everyone. It's a nice product consistency-wise with a lovely, mild fragrance, but I did not notice any difference in the last three weeks I've used it. I applied it daily in the mornings after cleansing, and my skin was nicely moisturized. Unfortunately, I did not observe any dramatic effects that would make this product superior to a nicer brand that I can find at a drugstore, or to other Caudalie moisturizers I've tried. It certainly would not justify the price. Maybe it makes a difference that I don't drink enough water and I'm always exhausted wrangling three toddlers at home. For me, this is a no-go.

Too heavy for me but that’s no justification to take off a point. The things is, it smells very intense (herbal? lavender? what is this?).

The only good part for me is also the shimmer, looks great on the skin, sort of like a glowy and extremely moisturizing primer.', 'I received a sample and decided to give it a go as it’s been very cold where I live and my skin has been very dry. After one use the moisture to my face recovered and my face wasn’t wind whipped anymore. Very hydrating.

I had acne in my teens and now at 37, my skin has a few age spots and discoloration as well as dryness in my cheeks and forehead. I’ve been using cerave because it’s gentle but it has always felt like it works when you first apply but it doesn’t last throughout the day and I have never seen an overall improvement in my skin texture, just seems like a temporary solution. but the wishful honey balm is my new fave. 1) the scent is NOT as strong as some other reviews indicated- it’s subtle and does not last 2) it feels like silk and just rolls on so smoothly 3) perhaps most importantly, I’ve seen lasting results in just three days using the product at night before bed and in the morning. My skin looks visibly brighter and softer and I keep touching my face because I can feel the difference. I put makeup on over it and my skin stays well hydrated all day (no flaking or dryness after application). I definitely think it’s worth trying.', 'Very good to use in cold weather.

Most of my life I had oily skin, until having babies, and now it’s dry but the blackheads on my nose remain. I have noticed this sort of blurring them out and helping my pores appear smaller. There’s a slight tingly sensation (from the niacinamide, I’m sure) but I enjoy when things feel like they’re actually doing something. The honey is great for antimicrobial properties, so if you have blemishes this would be ideal for you. The only thing I would suggest is to scale down on the scent.

You will still be a shiny, specially if you have oily or combo skin, but at age 40, I would rather moisturize my skin, and protect it from the sun.

Your skin would look so fresh and moisturized in the morning. I loved it. This is the only night cream I have actually though that makes some difference. I finished one bottle and I am trying the sleeping collagen from Algenist now, just to try something new.', 'After using this product for 4 months I have to say this product isn’t for me. I’m 32 years old and this product was too harsh on my skin. I used it at night and next morning my face was never fresh. It always felt dry, tired and over exhausted skin, completely opposite of what I was expecting. For a cream this expensive I was really hoping for something else and therefore I waited months before giving this review. It’s too late to return but I regret wasting so much money on this product. Didn’t work out for my skin.', ""Creamy texture that quickly becomes oily when rubbed onto the skin. Definately hydrating, but takes a while to dry down. Mild scent, though perfum is not listed. For a 110$ price tag you expect wow in a bottle- i didn't get that. A lot of people mention loving this when gifted as a sample, and why wouldn't you. However at 110$ there is no love here. Just an average cream with slighty above average hydration."", 'This is the best! It balances out the oil in my sometimes oily, sometimes dry, sometimes combination skin. It’s not greasy, and a little goes a long way. If you splurge on it, you can really make it last. I can use it in all seasons, and it will make my skin look flawless. I’ve struggled with acne for years, and this has never broken me out. Seriously the best moisturizer I’ve ever used.', ""Nothing special. Used the entire product. Did not really see any difference in my complexion or hydration that I wouldn't have seen using my serums and pharmacy brand moisturizer."", 'great night cream - highly recommend it!', 'Just purchased my 3rd bottle with the sale event.

As far as wrinkle reducer, didn't work for me."", ""I've been using this night cream on and off for years. It's amazingly rich and plumps my skin right up! This is the product that got me into Algenist (I now use a few of their products). The first time I used it, it seemed like my skin was smoother the next day! It has never broken me out or caused irritation and I believe it is scent-free. That said, for the last year or so I was using a couple of different products instead and now that I've switched back to this, I'm finding it a bit too rich! I have slightly oily skin and I find this actually makes me oilier during the day. I think when I run out I'll replace it with their Regenerative Anti-Aging Moisturizer (non-SPF) again. Even though it's meant as a day cream, I find it rich enough to use at night for oilier skin types. But for those of you with dry skin, I'd recommend this in a heartbeat!"", 'No matter how you feel you look going to bed, if you put this on at night you will feel better in the morning. Definitely feels good going on and I have \nless irritation in the morning. Worth the price, boyfriend is also obsessed.', 'Makes moisturizing easy, just apply before bed. This is a very thick cream.

Thank you!', 'I love this cream- a little goes a long way! My skin feels amazing when I wake up.  I received this product as a free sample and bought it right away.', 'I never leave reviews but I had to testify about this moisturizer. I am 28 and I’ve never been able to use night creams because I am prone to breakouts and they would all clog my pores. This moisturizer is a God-send. It actually heals any blemishes faster, reduces fine lines (I’ve seen a difference around the eyes), and it’s supposed to brighten but it’s only been 2 weeks so I can’t confirm that yet. My only gripe is that I wish it was a bit more moisturizing as my skin drinks this right up but I’ll take it. It’s totally worth the price. I don’t need to try anything else.', ""I've used Algenist Miracle cream and liked it, so when in the market for an overnight cream, I decided to give Algenist Overnight Restorative Cream a try.  During the two  months during which I've used it, I found nothing to like about it and noticed no benefit to my skin.

This toner definitely deserves an A++ for results I absolutely love it! There is a smell at first which goes away after 2-3 minutes after application. Smell is  comparable to a rose/flower water spray it doesn’t smell terrible. Also toner is sticky (just like every other toner) for the first 5 - 10 minutes once it’s a absorbed into the skin sticky feeling goes away.

Going back to Farmacy clean sweep.', 'I love this toner. It makes my skin feel clean and hydrated and I love that it’s alcohol-free. I really feel like it leaves my skin less oily throughout the day, and the spray bottle reduces waste of cotton pads! It’s pricey, but I think it’s worth it.

I can't recommend a product that is so inconsistently produced."", 'My face feels sticky after using this product. Will be returning.

Within a few days of using it I noticed a brighter complexion!', 'This product feels nice to use but definitely doesn’t do much for oil control. You’re better off buying serums and moisturizers that manage oil. Looks pretty on my skin care shelf I guess...', ""When I decided I needed a new toner I did a lot of research. I wanted alcohol free , and one free of a lot of other harmful ingredients, too. I wanted one that would help control oil and refine pores. I finally landed on this. It met all my criteria, plus it smelled wonderful.  But it was THIRTY NINE DOLLARS!! But I had to try it! And I did, and now I'm hooked.  *sigh* It's worth it. Really, it is. My skin has really improved because of it. But I really, REALLY wish they would come down on the price!"", 'This product is ""meh"".

However, I wouldn't call it oil-controlling. My skin can great pretty oily throughout there day, and this helps a little bit, but it isn't amazing. But it's better than everything else I've tried. I'm knocking it down to three stars because it's s too expensive."", 'I did not like this product. The only thing nice about it is the packaging and the fact that it comes in a glass bottle.

Actually I don’t even know why I bought because I still don’t know it does but I am so happy that I did because my skin looks like camera ready even without makeup on. Of course I use other products and mostly Lancôme ones that I love so bad. But this product added something that I really enjoyed to my makeup free face.', 'This stuff is amazing. I have extremely dry and sensitive skin yet I do get acne. Most acne treatments are far too harsh and irritating for my skin but this gives so much hydration while clearing up my redness and acne. Can’t recommend this enough. Well worth the price.', 'Herbivore claims this is normal “sediment” in their lapis oil, but they’ve had issues with mold in the past so beware.  Extremely disappointing when the product is so expensive and does not last.  Herbivore claims this oil should last at least a year and it barely made it six months - I kept it out of direct sunlight and never touched the dropper directly to my skin or hands. I’ll be finding a dupe for this because it’s not worth the money.', 'This stuff is amazing, I have dry, red and acne prone skin and this visibly smooths out my acne scars and texture and gives my face the hydration it needs. Even if you have dry skin, you can still use it.', 'I absolutely love this facial oil. I have combination skin, where my cheeks and forehead are very dry and my nose area is very oily. This is the only product that genuinely controls it all, and it’s been incredibly helpful in holding down my cyclical serum routine. It’s very light yet super powerful in how it balanced my skin within just a few days. My skin is sensitive so it’s also prone to redness, and other oils burned my skin or were too heavy, but this alone has been phenomenal. I use 4 drops on my entire face after cleansing and using toner/ serum. \nAll in all, this is one of the best products I’ve used. Highly recommend', 'I noticed a difference the next day after using this once. I have sensitive oily/combination and VERY acne prone skin (most of which is hormonal too) and i’ve been looking for an oil to gua sha with and this is the one!!! my skin is so much more balanced and SOFT and just looks better overall.

I’m so happy  this exists.', 'I was always on the fence about buying this because of the price tag. But now I’m regretting not buying it earlier! I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin (most of which is hormonal). Nothing has worked for me until this. My skin is CLEAR for the first time in my life. It’s the only thing that has ever worked for me. I’ve had it for 3 months, and use it morning and night in place of my moisturizer. Can probably squeeze another month out of it! If you can afford it, I would definitely suggest giving this a try!', 'I have suffered from severe acne for the past couple of months and nothing has worked for me.

The only downside is it does have a natural smell that’s a bit funky (not floral/perfumey or anything) but I do find you get used to it! I have issues with fragrance and I can use it. It’s the perfect oil to give softness to your skin even if you are acne prone. Highly recommend!', 'I wanted to like this product but it just didn’t work for my skin. It does not absorb into my skin at all and leaves it sticky. I have tried it so many times that now I just stopped trying. It also did nothing on my skin. I didn’t see any positive affects. It did also start irritating my skin.', 'I liked this blue tansy oil, and it is beautiful, but I have had the same result using rosehip oil, which is much less expensive and has more antioxidants. I am in my late 20s and have oily, acne-prone skin. I would highly recommend anyone of this skin type to try using about 5 drops of oil on the skin twice a day between toner and moisturiser. It definitely reduces my oiliness. I use more in winter and less in summer. I would say try this oil if you do not get a satisfactory result with rosehip oil. They are definitely similar.', 'I was very skeptical of putting an oil on combo oily skin with an acne breakout, but it works. it moisturized the dry areas and the breakout areas with adding greasy-ness.', ""Part 1: I love the product itself. Others don't seem to like the smell, but I love it. It's like homemade grape jelly with warming spices- wholesome and comforting. \n\nPart 2: As other reviews said, it goes bad QUICKLY.

So I used the chat on the Sephora app to ask for recommendations for more reasonably priced products that serve a similar purpose to my most used drunk elephant products.  This was recommended as a substitute for the marula oil, and I must say, I actually like it a lot more! I think my skin is benefiting a lot more from this stuff.

I find that it actually helps me be less oily throughout the day, but doesn't leave my skin dry or wanting for moisture.  It works great for my hair too!  The only thing is the packing; I'm torn.  I appreciate the convenience of the pump, but it can be a little tricky to control the amount of product you dispense.  I'm grateful they include a little clip to lock it when you're not using it.  This has replaced so many products for me.  I am so happy with this purchase!"", ""I am giving this 3 stars because this is a lightweight,  virtually odorless, and multipurpose oil. That's all.

Also seems to help hydrate better (Unless it’s the Amino Aloe Cleanser or hyaluronic toner as I started using all three at the same time).\n\nSpeaking specifically to this product it isn’t as heavy as other oils. Absorbs into my skin faster.  I also started putting this in my hair and Wow. My hair is so smooth, shiny and hydrated.  I have wavy hair that is kind of frizzy. It’s heat treated with a flat iron couple times a week because I haven’t made the effort to get the curls more hydrated. This does seem to do that. My hair is a lot curlier when I apply a pump/pump and a half after washing. It can make the hair stick together and look a little oily if you over apply but I find I put extra on during the weekend. Then it doesn’t so much matter and over the span of a day or so it does lose the oiliness (again this is if applying a pump each side of the head. Which is more than is really needed). Half pump each side would likely do without being oily. I will be buying this again even if just for what it does to my hair.', ""Make sure to apply just a little bit because it can be thick, but it's great very hydrating"", 'I have multiple autoimmune diseases that can cause rashes on my face and body. I also have very sensitive and dry skin, so finding a moisturizer that works for me can be a huge challenge. After finding this moisturizer and the Biossance cleansing oil, my skin has improved dramatically (sorry, no before and after shots. I’m writing this after using this product for a while). I had some light red scarring along my cheekbones that went away completely. I also started using this product on my upper arms, where I get rashes as well. I use a prescription lotion for that rash that never completely cleared it up.

With a very light clean scent almost non existent. I love adding a few drops to moisturizer or patting on my face alone after cleansing :)', 'I don’t have incredibly dry skin to the point where it’s irritated, flakey or itchy but I do have combo/dry skin. This product is super perfect for my skin because it’s not a heavy oil and does not feel too greasy, it absorbs well instead of just sitting on my skin. It smells like hemp, it is lightweight and a little goes a long way! I personally really like it. I usually apply oils as the last part of my night skincare routine or mix a drop with my moisturizer. I like it! If you want to “splurge” on a product, go for this one.', ""Love this oil for the summertime when all other face oils run too thick. It's fragrance-free, but with the hemp oil, it's got a natural, pleasant scent. I don't use more than a few drops a day, and it moisturizes dry spots without irritating areas prone to breakouts. Definitely recommend!"", 'I have a skin picking problem, any blemish I see I need to mess with it and my face looks red and covered in sores after. This oil calms my face down within minutes! It definitely helped healing my face as well, normally I use a regular ointment. If you’re worried about this being an “oil” , it’s non greasy and sinks into my skin quickly. It was more of an impulse buy for me but I’m just genuinely so amazed by the quality of this product.  If you are looking for something to comfort your face you definitely need to give this a try.', 'I absolutely loved this oil. I have eczematic skin, and found this so calming, as well as super hydrating for my overly dry skin. \nHowever, the reason i’ve rated it 3 stars is due to the packaging. I’ve purchased 2 bottles, and with both, the dropper disintegrated before I even finished half the bottle. It ended up being a huge waste of product, and very disappointing', 'A small amount goes a long way. Fabulous overnight - skin feels so soft in the AM.', 'This oil is amazing for sensitive or dry skin skin. I been using this  product for about a year and I been going getting amazing results like my skin is so smooth and glowing after using this oil. I love it and truly would keep buying it.', 'I used it for one night on my very irritated red spot on my face where the mask touches, and I was Pleasantly surprised on the next morning to see that red spot was healed and not itchy anymore!! \nI had to mention though, that this is super strong!  I had some spill over oil on my right palm (a very big dog almost knocked the bottle over the table) and I forgot to wipe off... next morning my entire right palm skin came off!! It’s only a thin layer and made my skin plump, but it scared me a bit. So please remember to use a tiny bit at a time!! For whole face, I use three drops and I have a huge face. For a spot treatment, a smallest drop at a time!! \nI have sensitive skin, and spring and summer I’ll have allergy hives and redness on my cheeks and forehead. I also have eczema on my hands and arms due to hand sanitizer/excessive hand washing during covid. This oil helps calming those allergy and eczema itchiness and redness. I also noticed my skin is generally more moisturized after few days of using twice a day, morning and night.', 'I was skeptical of this but it’s worked wonders on my rosacea. Better than Dr. Jart cica!', ""I've always been worried about trying a facial oil, but I was looking for a serum that would help even out the redness in my face while providing hydration. I absolutely love this serum! A little goes a long way, and I love using it at nighttime and letting it sit a bit before adding my night moisturizer."", 'I use this dry oil whenever my skin is feeling stressed out.

I love letting it set in a bit before applying my day time moisturizer and make up.', 'I have acne prone dry skin. I used oil free products for years, no acne, but very dry skin. Then I got a trial size of this oil and I was afraid to try it. Once I did, I discovered my skin has been in need of a good oil! I add it before my moisturizer and keeps my skin soft! No acne! It has helped me so much with mask wearing irritation. It’s soothing for the skin and the natural scent also soothes my soul. It’s a must have for me. I also use it as a primer before foundation when using a matte foundation. Very versatile product.', 'This formulation feels so good to put on. It’s not heavy of an oil and makes your skin feel nourished! I can wear this during the day with makeup and at night. Best oil I’ve ever tried by far, and the price isn’t that bad.', 'Love how calming this product was for my skin!

I have dry skin and acne hyperpigmentation and it soothes my skin.', 'I have used this for 3 years and nothing performs quite as well. Truly, a little scoop is adequate so I believe you will find it to be a great value. This sleeping facial is like a duvet to protecting your skin especially in harsh winter weather. I would use this during outdoor winter sports but especially at night as a moisturizer + benefits. You will notice after application how it immediately softens your face and in the morning your complexion is brighter and overtime the evening of your tone is noticeable. The texture of the product is like softened butter and is a joy to use. As the other reviews mention it does have a rose sent that is somewhat dated but as you only need a little bit the sent is not too heady and dissipates quickly.

I have very dry skin and wanted a product that helped with that plus provided other benefits. This was what I decided to try and soooo happy I did.

I don't know why this isn't talked about more.  This didn't irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin and it's got great skincare ingredients (bakuchiol, ceramides).    I find one pump does do the job, and I can apply it to my face and neck, it just isn't as smooth as other moisturizers I have used that also have a thick texture (Belif, Sunday Riley).  It lasted about 2.5 months, which I find to be on par. The downside is the texture + pump.  Its texture is pretty thick - not as emollient as I would like.  I had A LOT of product left at the bottom, so I suggest getting a little scoop to get it out or turning it upside down once you notice it's not dispensing as well.

I have sensitive, acne prone skin. I purchased this because I had over processed and damaged my skin barrier with to many active ingredients which led me to having even more severe clogged pores and more frequent breakouts.My skin was flaking, yet oily as it was trying to overcompensate for the lost moisture. Only 4 days into using this stuff and my complexion has completely cleared, no more flaking, and the redness has reduced significantly. I hardly have any more clogged pores.

I bought this as a a dupe for the protini moisturizer from drunk elephant but it failed the test. This leaves a slightly greasy feeling on my skin and does not provide the same 'radiant' look the drunk elephant cream does. It feels like it takes a while to absorb into the skin and overall it's just not anything special. This will probably work best on normal to dry skin.

I have tried many high-end products from my Derm and others, but this is the best. Algenist has kept my skin in top shape-- seriously- my Derm, friends, and strangers comment on my skin. I do pair it with Skinceuticals CE Furelic serum (just recently), but I really attribute my skin balance and radiance to their core products-  cream, eye cream, masks, and toner.', 'Really Just don’t . Save your money and buy another brand it’s not worth the time or money', ""At first I did not notice any effect. Some creams I've used are ones where you see a difference after one use. That said, after about 2 weeks I did see my skin is less inflamed, has less breakouts, more smoothness and is more hydrated. For that reason I will try this again in my rotation down the line. Not yet sure how helpful it is. All I know is that I saw nothing at first, but did see a gradual build up benefit."", ""Review based on free sample. You know that smell when you leave the laundry in the washer too long? That's what this cream smells like. I had to wash it off. The texture seemed odd too. Maybe mine went bad? Don't know, but I won't be purchasing to find out."", 'Unfortunately for my bank account, this is the one product to solve all my issues at once: dryness, rosacea flares, and fine lines around my eyes.', 'Love this fluffy cream! I’ve been using for three years as a night cream. I like to pile it on and in the morning, my skin is so soft and glows. My skin is super sensitive and this doesn’t cause any irritation/ acne. Better than any $200+ cream I’ve bought.', 'I am 35 and a couple years ago noticed really deep worry lines on my forehead. I’ve tried everything (seriously everything outside of major surgery) to reduce their appearance. I got visible results after one use with this product. Of course the lines are not gone completely, but they are far less visible. I had a hard time justifying the price at first but it works so well and takes very little to cover my entire face. My only complaint is that, because I have dry sensitive skin, I’ve noticed a lot of dryness around my mouth towards the end of the day.', ""Ehhh, so the fragrance is fine and this is a decent moisturizer. The uber thick pudding texture is off-putting and it doesn't absorb well - I noticed flaking on my next the next morning from where it hadn't absorbed which was gross. I've been using this for a month and I haven't noticed any real difference. This certainly isn't magical and for the price, I won't be repurchasing."", 'I got this in a sample. I do like quite a few algenist products but i dont think about buying a lot of them since they are quite pricey. I ended up only using this at night after my tretinoin and it calmed my irritated flaky skin. It sank into my skin pretty fast so that was nice. The smell of this stuff is fantastic too. It just smells fresh and clean. Not like perfume.', 'When I have skin irritation that just won’t go away, switching to algenist always solve the problem. It’s overall calming and offers just the right amount of moisture for my sensitive combination skin. After trying many medium and lower priced moisturizers, I decided to keep my routin simple with rose water and this Algenist cream. (Occasional dab of Origins mushroom toner does wonder in dissolving my skin problems too). The texture is unusual; the first time I tried it yeas ago I was very skeptical, but I’ve come to love it. It feels as if the spongy texture is to keep the cream in a steady state until it melts on the skin into just the right fatty particle size.', ""I've been using this for years now.

I try other Sephora lotion samples, but nothing else I've tried absorbs the same and is as rich."", 'Nothing will ever compare to this!  Worth every penny, even though it’s a lot of pennies.  I have tried so many moisturizers including SkinCeuticals, and nothing works like this.  It is like Botox in a jar.  I have one wrinkle that goes straight across my forehead, and when I use this, the wrinkle is gone.  Cleared up my skin, and gave it a beautiful glow. I do use SkinCeuticals for the serums, but this on top is magic!', 'I received a sample of this and I was very excited to try it. It smelled nice and the thick, creaminess felt good when applied. Unfortunately it began peeling and flaking off minutes later and my skin was left with a greasy texture. My skin felt worse than before I applied it. I wouldn’t purchase this.', 'My favorite moisturizer! I’m on my third jar now. I’d say it’s probably best for normal to dry skin. It smells kinda like French vanilla ice cream lol but not over powering at all. I personally love it and find it to be light. I use this and the collagen serum as my daytime duo.

After a month of use, I have realized this is best as a night eye cream or no makeup eye cream, as it did seem to make my under eye concealer and eyeshadow crease like crazy. Sad to see so many negative reviews for such a great product!"", ""Life changed. I don't really wear makeup so I can't say if it moves makeup or anything but for ppl who don't wear makeup I'm not joking this is worth every penny"", ""I'm switching to vegan skin care and I really wanted this to work for me but unfortunately after using it for a couple weeks my skin started getting really sensitive and then red patches started showing up under my eye. I stopped and then tried after a few weeks and the same thing happened. I'm probably allergic to something in the ingredients because now I'm getting similar red patches from Biossance night serum."", 'I like the consistency of this cream, though I have been using it for months and see no difference.']",71.0,cream days zero difference undereye skin cream feel smell nice skin recommend worth money better spend money cheaper effective cream cerave cetaphil amaze pick free sample try weeks apply morning night result days lift brighten eyelids eye dark discoloration turn concealer grey think gentle massage help impression texture heavenly feel nourish eye scent light disruptive area look brighter moisturizer dont issue firmness wrinkle comment want prevent banana bright cream cream give anti age benefit brighten benefit transition long term better expect best cream try intense moisturize properties greasy perfect follow infrared light lovely irritate cream soothe moisturize lighter like cream soak feel natural like richer consistency light keeper enjoy nightly receive free sample excite live biossance products ingredients good clean plump eye great fine line doesnt dark circle puffiness high hop product deal dark circle eye lack sleep days eye persevere think days bump eye hide primer foundation take weeks normal good expect skin doesnt feel essential moisturizer cream weeks notice crow feet finish hydrate eye go great nighttime cream amazingly hydrate tretinoin like apply cream prevent tretinoin migrate close eye eye nice hydrate night pretty work time tint sunscreen think help plump skin help appearance dark circle definitely repurchase cream incredibly moisturize obsess nice sensitive eye irritate like cream eyelids month realize best night cream makeup cream concealer eyeshadow crease like crazy negative review great product life change wear makeup move makeup wear makeup joke worth penny switch vegan skin care want work unfortunately couple weeks skin start get sensitive patch start show stop try weeks thing happen probably allergic ingredients get similar patch biossance night serum like consistency cream months difference
