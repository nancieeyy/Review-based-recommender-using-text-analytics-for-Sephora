Would not purchase again.', 'I like the performance and slight grit in texture but I will say that it does sting slightly.', 'I personally love it. As someone with sensitive skin and acne scars, it has significantly reduced the redness in my face! It doesn’t sting my face like other comments have mentioned. However, I only use it in the mornings. Vitamin C can be harsh on the body in the first place. \nIf you do really rub it in, it turns almost into an exfoliate which is not good to do everyday. I just lightly tap it in and it has worked for me. Also, can’t beat the price for it :)', 'Builds up and does not sink into the skin  you cannot put makeup after on it.', ""I use this every alternate day and after drying, I top it off with moisturiser. I noticed a slight difference in skin brightness so it works, but there's pilling and it stings a little- especially at first. \nI developed some rashes but I am not sure if it's the vit C or something else. I've read that this is a high concentration of Vit C and may not suit everyone, especially dry skin like mine. but I've never had a reaction to anything ever."", 'I have been using this product for about 2 years and it is awesome!  I know everyone complains about the grittiness but if you mix with a drop or 2 of the ordinary resveratrol + ferulic and emulsify between your fingers it basically gets rid of the grittiness!  Also this emulsion is a close dupe for a very pricey ( I won’t name the brand) vit C serum that is &gt; $160.00 for a tiny bottle with a dropper so it is less stable!!!!!', 'Gritty texture, and stings the skin. It doesn’t sit well on the skin and I could only use if I do not have to go outside', 'Turns hands orange. Once hands are orange they are orange for a week. Not cool', 'The texture surprised me a bit. The HA spheres make it feel like an exfoliant, so if you have sensitive skin it might feel a bit abrasive and does sting a little. However it truly makes my skin GLOW. My skin tone always looks more even and dewy when I wear this.', 'It’s so oily that I had to rinse it out after 20min. Still, it caused breakouts on my chin and forehead\n.', 'I find that trying to rub product in it balls up on your skin. Can’t even add a moisturizer on top. Hsve to wash it off and start over.', 'I was excited to try this product, but I got really disappointed! The texture is very granulated. Also, with just a bit of the product for a few seconds, the skin burned as if the face was on fire. I already use vitamin C on my face and have never had a reaction to the products.', 'Yes, it’s going to feel gritty bc it’s a “suspension”. Read about what that actually means. \nSo, I’ve used many different vitamin c serums with different results. I love this one because it does not make my skin oily, it doesn’t stink, and it truly works. I believe it’s best used after the glycolic acid toner. Both vit c serums do feel tingly for a few min, this is normal. My skin is now even toned, I go makeup free quite often, and it’s so smooth - awesome for makeup application! LOVE IT', ""It works great!! it burns a bit when you first put it on until you get used to it. it has a gritty texture. if either of those bother you Sephora offers a less intense vitamin c cream and it isn't gritty. this one has the best effect though as it is stronger. watching the video about it here is VERY informative and I absolutely recommend. I put it on my face twice a week at night before bed. and then wash it off in the morning. start off doing it once a week until your face gets used to it. it does have a bit of a smell like old pennies but you get used to it."", 'Honestly, I love this product, and it works amazing for my acne scars/hyperpigmentation, I notice when I use it I have this dewy glow! BUT - no matter what I do, this product somehow always leaves my nails stained this disgusting yellow colour (oxidization). Ive tried washing my hands, using something else to apply the product, gloves, nothing works. This makes my face a bit itchy and tingly, so I touch my face often, hence the yellow nails. I took off one star for this.']"

I love how this moisturizer comes with an applicator so that I can choose how much I want to use AND I don’t have to come into contact with the rest of it with my fingers. A little goes a LONG way with this moisturizer. Seriously. I use about the size of a pomegranate seed each time I apply. It fully blends into my face and absorbs beautifully.

I recently started tretinoin for acne and my skin has been incredibly dry. Not only that, but because of my acne in the past, I have struggled to find a moisturizer that works for me. This stuff is gold!! I love the formula. It is definitley a good winter moisturizer for the dryer months - I have not used it during the warmer months.

Writing this review for anyone with skin like mine. It can be discouraging wearing make up and just seeing the dry looking texture underneath foundation.

I’ve been using for a little over a year now and my skin has changed drastically', 'I got this as a free sample and the first time I used it I was convinced that I was going to hate it. I’m VERY fair with oily/combo/sensitive skin. When I first applied it I was underwhelmed. The cream instantly melted to (what felt like) water upon contacting my face and it kind felt like I was just smearing H2O around. BUT the magic happens once it’s had a chance to absorb for a few moments. My skin felt SO soft and silky. It somehow manages to make your face feel moisturized but somehow super soft like a rose petal. It leaves zero film, tackiness or stickiness. I love that it’s oil-free and doesn’t make me breakout but I feel like my skin is drinking it up. I use an extra dab around my eyes for extra hydration as most other facial moisturizers make the skin around my eyes sensitive and burn. I’m the type of person who can’t stick with one product long enough to use up a whole container but after I finished the sample I splurged on the full size.', 'I’ve always had such oily skin. After an hour in my makeup I would already feel a layer of oil on my cheeks. Well not anymore! After only 1 week I noticed a difference in my oil production. I’ve now been using it for over a year and I’m repurchasing a third! I now have combination skin and my pores look smaller since I don’t produce as much oil. My skin looks amazing. The best skin care find of my life. Please bring back the value size!!!', 'I wanted to love this water cream so badly because everyone that i know that has used this loves it. however that wasn’t the case for me. i have a love hate relationship. i love how lightweight but nourishing this feels. but i hate how it breaks me out. i’ve been using this for 5 days now (morning and night) and noticed that by the end of the day and when i wake up i’ll find a new pimple. the pimples aren’t large pustules, but they are small under the surface bumps and white heads. i kept blaming it on other things in my skincare, however everything else in my skincare was the same and i had to face the reality that the water cream had broken me out.']"

The bottle is luxurious and the product is easy to apply.', 'I’ll be honest I was nervous to try this because retinol makes me break out.

I was honestly unbothered by this and was only going to use it because I got it in these kits. \n\nOh. My. God. \n\nI am not someone who believes in buying such an expensive product for something like moisturizer but wow. I was using this under makeup and at night just to use it up and my skin has been SO SMOOTH since I started using this. I sorted out my acne for the most part about two years ago but I still gets small bumps that aren’t really acne.

I'm sorry, but feet is not what I want to smell like. I know it's a natural product, but I feel it would be better with a hint of scent, maybe lemon, or rose.

I put it on under my mineral sunscreen. \nPeople are speaking of an odor. Well I looked at some of the pics of the consistory of the cream. I think the company might have fixed the odor because I smell absolutely no odor and the consistency of my cream looks more firm. Also the odor could have been from the squalene.

My only issue is I wish they would package this in a tube and it is pricey, but it works.', 'Suffered from a compromised moisture barrier due to over exfoliation.

I don’t notice the scent that everyone else is saying… it does have some sort of a scent but not in a way that’s overpowering or off putting in my opinion.

The texture is like a watery gel (you can definitely pour it out if you tip the jar) and you don’t need a lot of product to cover your face. I find that it actually absorbs/dries fairly quickly so it won’t rub all over your pillow and blanket. I’ve accidentally rubbed my face and it definitely pilled/rolled off onto my hand (but that’s not a problem to me, since I’m not applying makeup on top and I’d wash it off in the morning).

Really great daytime moisturizer.', ""There's something wrong with the mini version, the one I received was only ~30% filled and a super dark brown color. It seems like the seal is not glued properly and so a lot of the moisture evaporated. From what I've seen of other reviews this has been happening for a while - I would not recommend buying it until they get rid of this batch. I did return it in store and bought a full size instead (they didn't have the mini size in store) and the checkout person was shocked at the condition of it.\n\nProduct itself is wonderful. It has an interesting texture where it doesn't feel thick but is very hydrating and works well even in the cold winters of Toronto. A little goes a long way. But it does break me out around my T zone, so I use a much lighter moisturizer overall and apply this around my cheeks and dryer spots. It's always super hydrated and looks/feels great the next morning.""]"

It contains caffeine from coffee beans and ginseng to help with “waking-up” the skin. When choosing a face moisturizer for myself, I love to find products that are hydrating and lightweight.  I don’t like wearing thick moisturizers because I usually wear sunscreen and makeup in conjunction with a moisturizer.  I have a normal to dry skin type, so I can usually go for any moisturizer.  Upon opening the lid, I did notice a citrus smell.  It smelled like oranges. So if someone is sensitive to smell, this item may not be ideal.  The texture of the moisturizer was lightweight and non-greasy.  The moisturizer wasn’t too thick at all.  I believe that it would be comfortable for cold and hot days, since it’s not too thick.  Personally, this gel moisturizer didn’t cause any redness or irritation, and it didn’t leave a sticky or tackiness residue on my face.  Overall, I believe that this product, the Origins Ginzing Oil-Free Energy Boosting Gel Moisturizer, would be perfect for all skin types.  All in all, I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends.', ""I have been using this for almost a week and so far, my skin likes it. It gives my skin moisture without making it feel super oily or greasy (like other moisturizers). I love the scent and how it's very lightweight."", 'Love this moisturizer! Leaves my skin nice and moisturized and does NOT make my skin appear shiny. Also smells great :)', 'My skin is oily and sensitive. I usually turn red from face products.. or they over moisturize and I’m a grease ball. I am SO IMPRESSED with this lotion!!! Even my husband started using. After 2 weeks of daily use.. my skin is RADIANT! So soft, not oily, even complexion… the list goes on. I have an obsession with trying “new” skincare and this is definitely one of the few products I’ll be buying again once it’s gone! (And a little goes a long way!)']"

Blended with brush, fingers, and sponge and neither times had a good outcome. I have tried it with different sunscreens and moisturizers under and it just doesn’t do it for me. A tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be so finicky. And a moisturizer should moisturize, but the flakes and the breaking apart shows this one isn’t as hydrating as others. I’m returning this one.

It's like rotting seaweed. The ingredients say there is fragrance added...which means this odor is intentional!? \n3. I have oily acne prone skin, so I appreciated the mattifying and pore-tightening effect of the Counter Balance. This product does not claim to be mattifying, so fair enough, it certainly isn't. It does not provide a good base for my makeup and I'm greasy within an hour of washing my face and applying this. My pores remain unchanged. And I've only been using it a week, so I have yet to see if it makes me break out, but I will definitely be returning it before I wait to find out. \n\nThis is unfortunate as I am a huge proponent of Ole Henriksen's products.

I do like that it absorbs quickly and the texture is nice but the one drawback that seems to outweigh all the positives is that the cooling sensation is wayyy too intense for me and lasts for over an hour after application. The best way to describe it is that it feels extremely minty (not in a good way). I feel like im not able to use it often enough for it to help with the things its supposed to help with (acne, pores, etc).

I wouldn’t necessarily say that it has staying power in terms of keeping my make up on longer than usual but it also doesn’t cause it to come off any sooner.

I am not a huge fan of this moisturizer. I have oily and acne prone skin, and unfortunately, it kind of made my skin shiny. If you had dry skin, this lotion would give you a nice dewy finish all day.

This product did not disappoint and makes my skin feel fresh in the mornings and at night before going to bed! Highly recommend and i think it works great for combination skin!', 'My skin is OILY, and I live in south Florida. As you can imagine, the struggle of keeping my skin under control (especially under a mask) is REAL! As a result, I have purchased numerous moisturizers over the years that have all supposedly been for oily skin. They have all been a complete failure. I also have an extensive skincare routine using aha/bhas, vitamin c, and retinol. So I really dont want my moisturizer to do double duty by having active ingredients in the formula- which has been quite a challenge. This moisturizer has changed the game! Truly a moisturizer that is trying to serve the group it was made for- oily folks! Too many moisturizers that claim to be for oily skin are actually trying to suit multiple skin types (I get it, companies make more money that way). I have no idea how this company made this magic happen, but my search is over. If you have oily skin and are looking for a basic moisturizer without actives, THIS IS IT! With all that being said, if you have dry/normal skin you should skip this and use something more appropriate for your skin type.', ""I like the consistency of the product, it feels as it's described which I appreciate, a lightweight gel mosturizer, it does the job and doesn't feel heavy on the skin.

Thank you so much for this product,', 'It’s a really fun texture! I’ve never had a gel moisturizer and I love it. It absorbed really fast into the skin and left it sticky and ready for my make up. I would say this is more of a medium moisture but still great for everyday', 'I was gifted this product and it’s probably a new favorite of mine for a gel moisturizer. It is light but hydrating and doesn’t leave my face feeling oily. I also love the applicator, it reminds me of a serum. It’s perfect for a day without makeup to hydrate and glow your skin.', 'Wow. What do I even say?? I have been looking for a new moisturizer that I actually like and does not breakout my skin! This is the product I’ve literally been searching for. I highly recommend.

For my particular skin type (combination, sensitive, acne prone) it made my face extremely red, didn’t absorb whatsoever (I tried using 4 drops and then I tried using 1 drop - didn’t make a difference) and it actually made me break out (I’m on an acne medication and I haven’t broken out in a while) so that was new for me. Keep in mind that it’s different for everyones skin, so it may work for others!\nI suggest trying out the mini size first before dropping $68 on this oil.', 'I love this stuff! I use a retinol for acne; I used to have oily skin but it’s made my skin incredibly dry and flaky. I use this face oil in conjunction with the La Roche-Posay eczema cream and my face was back to being nice and soft in a matter of days. I only use 6 drops of it every night so it lasts forever. I added a pic so you could see how large the bottle actually is, I’ve used it for 3 weeks and it’s still super full.

I love skincare but this one really stings the wallet. That’s my negative, on the positive- I adore this oil. It has a light smell and it absorbs easy, I have even used makeup after and it doesn’t clump or get streaky.

The no.1 functional rule of moisturizers is: day creams are absorbent and able to be worn under makeup, night creams sit on the skin to last the whole night  - this moisturizer feels more like a night cream. It does not absorb at all and it pills incredibly easily - don't even think of trying to put your foundation on 20 minutes after applying it in the morning, it will become disgusting (I literally had to wash my makeup off, and this happened with primers and other foundations too). When I have worn it all day with light makeup on top (quality products, Chanel/Shiseido), my skin has looked awful by day's end - greasy and peeling. \nSo, I've relegated this to night cream territory, but even then it's not my favourite as it doesn't play well with other creams - once again, it pills. \nI was so excited about this cream and it was a splurge for a day cream that was earned by my love of other Caudalie products, but it does not live up to that standard. It does have some of those same lovely qualities - lovely scent and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. However, the negative far outweighs these benefits. I'd like to see Caudalie refine their Resvertrol range so it absorbs properly.\n\n(Side note - it's interesting how these products have so many promotional reviews and the few verified reviews of Resveratrol products often bring up the pilling and greasiness.

Unfortunately, I did not observe any dramatic effects that would make this product superior to a nicer brand that I can find at a drugstore, or to other Caudalie moisturizers I've tried.

Most of my life I had oily skin, until having babies, and now it’s dry but the blackheads on my nose remain. I have noticed this sort of blurring them out and helping my pores appear smaller. There’s a slight tingly sensation (from the niacinamide, I’m sure) but I enjoy when things feel like they’re actually doing something. The honey is great for antimicrobial properties, so if you have blemishes this would be ideal for you. The only thing I would suggest is to scale down on the scent.

I enjoy the extra sun protection it provides, especially living in sunny SoCal, and I never leave home without this moisturizer on!', 'I got this because I was looking for a moisturizer/spf in one product. This is just the right consistency for me and one of the first spf products to not feel overly heavy and give me breakouts. \nThere have been complaints in other reviews about heaviness and oiliness. I would agree this would not be the product for you of you already have oily skin. I have combo/dry skin and I love the glowiness it adds to my skin. Spf is so important and worth investing in.', 'Like others reviews said this moisturizer is very heavy. I have a normal type of skin and it makes it very oily after a few hours. If I use it I will have to put a mate foundation on top to minimize the oily shiny face it gives me. I really wished to like it more.', 'Best product I have ever bought from Sephora. I have very touchy, sensitive, combination skin and this feels, smells, and looks incredible. Makes my skin look luminous. It’s a pleasure to put this on in the morning. Please, Origins, keep making it!', 'I find it so hard to find a daily SPF that is not greasy and this is it! I love this product. I know it can be a standalone moisturizer, but I actually layer it on top of my regular daily cream.', 'I have dry skin. Not for my, its give me dry flaky patches.', 'I love this product. I use it daily all year long. It leaves skin a little brighter and protects. I am outside a lot.', 'I think this is a really fantastic moisturizer, however, it is very heavy and can be really oily and leave my face crazy shiny after I’ve applied it. It’s really used best (from what I found) if you put it on in small dots and use a face mist/spray of any kind, to help move it around on your face. It can make your face a little sticky after it dries from the oily stage. Which I’m not sure how I would feel about it normally, but now that I have to wear a mask 24/7 I have no breakouts or anything even with it being so heavy on my face.', 'It’s a little sunscreen-like thick which I typically don’t care for but it’s a very nice product.', 'I have normal to dry skin and it dried out my face so much that it was flaking. It sits under my makeup horribly as it made my face look dry! Btw, if anyone has any kind of sensitive skin, this will irritate you! Essential oils are skin irritants and there are a lot in here, and since they are at the top of the ingredients list, they are also in a high concentration in this product.', 'Wow! This is truly such a fantastic day moisturizer. I love the fact that it has SPF40, that way I feel my face is protected every day. This leaves such a nice healthy plumped hydrated glow to my skin, I even get compliments at how healthier my skin has been looking recently. The scent is light and barely-there, and it does not linger. This moisturizer also works perfectly underneath makeup. It helps my makeup look more natural and dewy! And a little bit goes a long way. I will definitely be adding this product to my permanent skincare routine and I encourage everybody to try it out as you will probably love it too!', ""I've been buying this moisturizer on and off for the past few years there's things I like and things I don't like.\nPros: I love that it has a nice high SPF to help protect my skin! I live in a very cold area so winter dryness is a real problem but I feel like this moisturizer with it's thick consistency keeps me well hydrated all winter. My blemish prone skin seems to handle this moisturizer really well, I don't think this has caused an increase in blemishes. It rubs in really well, no white cast on me and leaves my skin looking glowy and feeling plump.\nCons: It's a little greasy so for those with oilier skin or for myself in the summer months it can be a little much."", ""I picked this product up the first time because it's a moisturizer with SPF40 (I was looking for the two in one). The first time I put it on, I thought I would hate it because it's too greasy and heavy. But after a while, it sinks into the skin. You will still be a shiny, specially if you have oily or combo skin, but at age 40, I would rather moisturize my skin, and protect it from the sun. If you don't like the dewiness, you might not like this product. It didn't make me break out (although I normally don't have issues with breaking out), and I love the fact that it has a high SPF in a moisturizer. The smell is pleasant, it has a slight smell of SPF that does not bother me. It would probably be even better for someone with dry skin.I don't think I would enjoy it in a hotter humid weather, but in California, specially during winter, it's my go to. My skin looks fresh and bright when I use it, so I am happy. I just bought my second bottle. I recommend this product for all skin types."", 'I love this product. Perfect day cream, I love the fact that it protects from sun damage. The smell is light and subtle. Leaves a beautiful glow. Will definitely buy again.']"

I saw it recommended by scott barnes. love.', 'I’m giving 2 stars because I like the scent of this. I would normally never buy something with scent because it usually means instant hives for me (sensitive skin), but this doesn’t seem to bug me. It smells kind of like the soap isle at Whole Foods.\n\nOther than the smell, I really don’t enjoy this product. I have combo skin but live in a very dry climate and with winter my skin gets a little drier. I have also been using a strong retinol, so my skin is drier because of that. STILL, this product made my skin look so oily. It didn’t absorb, or look glowy at any point. It just sat on top of my skin like I swiped canola oil over my face. It held my makeup fine, but there are other primers that do this and don’t leave my skin looking oily in all the wrong places.']"

I do like how it feels on my skin and how it wears under makeup. However, I don't consider it to be SUPER hydrating especially during winter. I'd say it's perfect for summertime."", ""It didn't seem like it'll stay on my skin long enough by looking at the texture at first. It is a light lotion-type texture that glides on the skin fast.

The formula feels expensive considering the price tag and because of that putting into consideration that it is clean I will continue to buy!', 'The cream absorbs easily, performs well under makeup. Didn’t cause any irritations or redness. My skin feels moisturized for a bit after the application. The packaging is definitely on the simpler side if you care, but that also why the price is attractive. The box came damaged, which is not a big deal, but I also think it’s make more sense to put it in a box rather then a plastic envelope - obviously it doesn’t stay intact. The tube is also fairly small, which you can expect is you look at the amount of cream - 50 ml, but I’m one of those people who forgets to check and then gets surprised getting a small product, so be careful with that. I don’t think this tube will last me long.', 'This is my new favorite moisturizer! I love that is clean at Sephora and fragrance free! The quality is amazing and the price is even better!

My only gripe is that I wish it was a bit more moisturizing as my skin drinks this right up but I’ll take it. It’s totally worth the price. I don’t need to try anything else.', ""I've used Algenist Miracle cream and liked it, so when in the market for an overnight cream, I decided to give Algenist Overnight Restorative Cream a try.  During the two  months during which I've used it, I found nothing to like about it and noticed no benefit to my skin.

Also toner is sticky (just like every other toner) for the first 5 - 10 minutes once it’s a absorbed into the skin sticky feeling goes away.

However, I wouldn't call it oil-controlling. My skin can great pretty oily throughout there day, and this helps a little bit, but it isn't amazing. But it's better than everything else I've tried.

Actually I don’t even know why I bought because I still don’t know it does but I am so happy that I did because my skin looks like camera ready even without makeup on. Of course I use other products and mostly Lancôme ones that I love so bad. But this product added something that I really enjoyed to my makeup free face.', 'This stuff is amazing. I have extremely dry and sensitive skin yet I do get acne. Most acne treatments are far too harsh and irritating for my skin but this gives so much hydration while clearing up my redness and acne. Can’t recommend this enough. Well worth the price.', 'Herbivore claims this is normal “sediment” in their lapis oil, but they’ve had issues with mold in the past so beware.  Extremely disappointing when the product is so expensive and does not last.  Herbivore claims this oil should last at least a year and it barely made it six months - I kept it out of direct sunlight and never touched the dropper directly to my skin or hands. I’ll be finding a dupe for this because it’s not worth the money.', 'This stuff is amazing, I have dry, red and acne prone skin and this visibly smooths out my acne scars and texture and gives my face the hydration it needs. Even if you have dry skin, you can still use it.', 'I absolutely love this facial oil. I have combination skin, where my cheeks and forehead are very dry and my nose area is very oily. This is the only product that genuinely controls it all, and it’s been incredibly helpful in holding down my cyclical serum routine. It’s very light yet super powerful in how it balanced my skin within just a few days. My skin is sensitive so it’s also prone to redness, and other oils burned my skin or were too heavy, but this alone has been phenomenal. I use 4 drops on my entire face after cleansing and using toner/ serum. \nAll in all, this is one of the best products I’ve used. Highly recommend', 'I noticed a difference the next day after using this once. I have sensitive oily/combination and VERY acne prone skin (most of which is hormonal too) and i’ve been looking for an oil to gua sha with and this is the one!!! my skin is so much more balanced and SOFT and just looks better overall. I still use my tretinoin along side this and so far so good! hurts the bank account but it’s worth it. I’m so happy  this exists.', 'I was always on the fence about buying this because of the price tag. But now I’m regretting not buying it earlier! I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin (most of which is hormonal). Nothing has worked for me until this. My skin is CLEAR for the first time in my life. It’s the only thing that has ever worked for me. I’ve had it for 3 months, and use it morning and night in place of my moisturizer. Can probably squeeze another month out of it! If you can afford it, I would definitely suggest giving this a try!', 'I have suffered from severe acne for the past couple of months and nothing has worked for me. And I actually scheduled an appointment for accutane. 10 days before my appointment I bought lapis and after 48 hours I have seen SIGNIFICANT results', ""This is a decent oil and it worked fine with my skin, but I can't give it more stars because I won't be repurchasing. It has a distinct sweet/floral/chemical smell that I can't stand. I can't really describe it, I just know that I don't like it. Given the price, I recommend getting a sample of this before committing to buying."", 'I have suffered with oily skin and break outs for like forever and I have used this for 5 days so far. When I tell you I am in love with this product. I never do reviews!!!! This smell is different but you get used to it. No complaints!', 'This is a really great calming oil and it doesn’t break me out which is amazing. The only downside is it does have a natural smell that’s a bit funky (not floral/perfumey or anything) but I do find you get used to it! I have issues with fragrance and I can use it. It’s the perfect oil to give softness to your skin even if you are acne prone. Highly recommend!', 'I wanted to like this product but it just didn’t work for my skin. It does not absorb into my skin at all and leaves it sticky. I have tried it so many times that now I just stopped trying. It also did nothing on my skin. I didn’t see any positive affects. It did also start irritating my skin.', 'I liked this blue tansy oil, and it is beautiful, but I have had the same result using rosehip oil, which is much less expensive and has more antioxidants. I am in my late 20s and have oily, acne-prone skin. I would highly recommend anyone of this skin type to try using about 5 drops of oil on the skin twice a day between toner and moisturiser. It definitely reduces my oiliness. I use more in winter and less in summer. I would say try this oil if you do not get a satisfactory result with rosehip oil. They are definitely similar.', 'I was very skeptical of putting an oil on combo oily skin with an acne breakout, but it works. it moisturized the dry areas and the breakout areas with adding greasy-ness.', ""Part 1: I love the product itself. Others don't seem to like the smell, but I love it. It's like homemade grape jelly with warming spices- wholesome and comforting. \n\nPart 2: As other reviews said, it goes bad QUICKLY. I prepared for this when I bought it. I got it a mini fridge for my bathroom so it would stay preserved and out of the light. I NEVER let the dropper tip touch my fingers so I wouldn't introduce bacteria into the bottle. I got about 1/3 of the way through the product (2-3 drops a day, so this lasts a LONG time. Bought it in March 2020) and started to notice this white sludge on the bottom of the bottle and my face started reacting as well. \n\nPart 3: I'm glad they sell a smaller/trial sized version of this so I can continue to use but not have to shell out $$$ and only get to use 1/3 of the product I paid for.""]"

First of all, it absorbs soooo nicely onto my skin.

Also, it makes me break out and darkens my skin. It does the opposite to giving me a glow. I will use the remaining on my body and won’t be purchasing again. I don’t understand how it can have such nice reviews. I have sensitive &amp; dry skin in the winter. After readings the comments, I thought this would solve my dry skin problem and give me a glow. I know have 10ish pimples and my skin is still dry. I’ve been using for three weeks. I will stop now and continue my quest for a hydrating cream. I give up on the oils. It does not quench the skin. This one gave me painful breakouts. One was very painful and will leave a dark spot for several months. If you have sensitive, rich brown skin &amp; dry skin, don’t buy.

A not-too-heavy (a little goes a long way IMO) oil that gives you a nice glow and leaves your skin feeling supple.', ""I can't believe how well this goes on. I was worried I would feel oily.

This one is my far one of my favorites. Melts into my skin and makes it feel super plump and hydrated… I’m a fan!', ""My skin in Normal to dry, I use this Oil on top of my BB cream.

This oil gives my skin a nice glow without feeling oily."", 'I LOOOVE this product. By far one of my favorites and I get compliments whenever I wear it. It does wonders to my skin and I look naturally beautiful. I often don’t even need to wear makeup with it. Recommend!!!', 'I love this oil, great for sensitive skin! I’m on my 3rd bottle and will continue using this product. Works great for people that use retinol!', 'Only used a few times and the topper broke! For how much you pay the bottle shouldn’t fall apart so easily', ""I used to think my skin was just always oily and living in a humid climate I just accepted it. I always thought an oil would make it worse BUT oil's have saved me. My skin is NEVER oily. Always use as the last step because oils can penetrate serums, moisturizers, etc so it is best to use last. a little goes a long way. Always pat into the skin for best results.""]"

I love the texture of the cream, not his not too oily and feels like the right balance between light/heavy. It is hydrating and applies smooth. I find that it even helps to reduce redness.

As suggested by Sephora staff, I use an oil-based cleanser to remove.

It’s also more on the heavy weight side depending on how much you use at once. It also smells a little strong. \nIt made me breakout at first but my skin adapted to it. It also made it red on some areas like my cheeks but it went away after awhile. You can find cheaper and honestly better products than this. I lost my box and receipt so I didn’t end up taking it back. For the price it’s not worth it as there’s only a little blob in the packaging.

This is water and 20% castor oil garbage in a bottle. So embarrassing Caudale remove this product immediately.

I would never know it had almond oil which has a nice smell. Luckily, I’m a double cleanser, so my second cleanser had more work to do. Farmacy Green Clean is so much better.', 'it’s really great at melting your makeup and personally, i love it. it emulsifies a tiny bit when warm water is added but not enough to wear it becomes any kind of cleanser. either removing it with a wipe or double cleansing is necessary (i recommend double cleansing as it’s better for the environment because less wipes = less waste, but also double cleansing leaves you feeling cleaner). also really nice that i don’t have to scoop a little spatula or my fingers into any kind of jar, the pump makes it easy to use and more cleanly. overall you get a lot of product for a good price, and it works.', ""This is my perfect cleansing oil. It removes all my makeup without tugging or pulling skin. It works into a nice creamy lather with water and then rinses clean. I've tried many other cleansing oils/balms this one is the best."", 'Favorite pre-cleanse I’ve found so far! I’ve tried many pre-cleansing balms/oils and so far this is my favorite. I tried to branch out and use the Dermalogica Pre-cleanse oil to see how it stacks up, and instantly regretted not repurchasing the Caudalie! This product removed all of my eye makeup and sunscreen/face makeup easily, and leaves no residue when I go in with my face wash. It also doesn’t irritate my eyes which is a huge plus. If you are on the hunt for a makeup removing cleansing oil, I’d recommend this product!', 'This really doesn’t work as well as the Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm. This smells good and has a much sleeker package, but it just doesn’t take off eye makeup like I was hoping it would.', 'Effective, gentle and smells really good! Fair price point and good size.', ""This had no slip to it so it didn't work well as a first step makeup remover. I didn't find it worked well as a second step cleanser either. I returned this, I was pretty disappointed cause I love other products from this line."", 'It gets my makeup off and is a good size for price, but it’s not great. It smells nice! Very light scent. It’s super runny and gets EVERYWHERE, it drips down the pump and onto the bottle. It made me break out and my eyes burn, sadly. I really wanted to love this.', 'Really, REALLY wanted to love this, and it is pretty good, but there are better options out there. I have a pretty intense sensitivity to fragrant essential oils (eg bergamot and lavender oil/extract) and so many cleansing oils have them but not this one. Completely non-irritating and removes makeup fairly well, but it definitely never removes all my eye makeup and I find the product to be rather thick, making me have to rub it in harder than I’d prefer.', 'This is the best oil based cleanser I have ever used and I have tried many.  It goes on silky and takes off all my makeup including waterproof.  Rinses clean with no residue.', 'It does the job by removing makeup minimally, however when I wash and dry my face after, a lot of makeup still goes onto my towel. I’ll probably return and go back to the Dermalogica pre cleanse as that was the best for me and really removed all makeup', 'Really nice but a little irritating if it gets in the eyes.

I saw results pretty immediate after 1-3 times of using just in the morning along with the serum they sell to go with this.

I definitely recommend this if you also have acne prone skin because I do as well and this product was a good add on to my skin care regime.', 'I’ve only been using it for about a week, but so far I love it.  Before I got married I was dishing out all kinds of money for drunk elephant products on a regular basis, but now I need to be a little smarter with my finances. I can’t be spending $400 to restock all my skincare products…on top of makeup and everything else.  So I used the chat on the Sephora app to ask for recommendations for more reasonably priced products that serve a similar purpose to my most used drunk elephant products.  This was recommended as a substitute for the marula oil, and I must say, I actually like it a lot more! I think my skin is benefiting a lot more from this stuff.  I recently learned that squalane oil is more suitable for my skin type, so I think that might have something to do with it as well.

I enjoy it on the face, lashes, hair, body- everything.  It soaks in easily while still being hydrating enough to sooth dry skin.  It hasn't broken me out or caused irritation.  I find that it actually helps me be less oily throughout the day, but doesn't leave my skin dry or wanting for moisture.  It works great for my hair too!  The only thing is the packing; I'm torn.  I appreciate the convenience of the pump, but it can be a little tricky to control the amount of product you dispense.  I'm grateful they include a little clip to lock it when you're not using it.

My skin is always dry (worse in fall/winter) and this is the most hydrating oil without feeling greasy after applied.

Not only has it given a nice drink to my thirsty skin, it KEEPS me hydrated all day, and the biggest (most unexpected) plus is that this reduced the redness of the KP on my arms!!!

Love it!', 'I use this oil on my face and neck after showering at night.  I apply a moisturizer over it after and my face has never been this soft and glowing. by morning it has all sunk into the skin just leaving behind the softness', 'This is so much lighter than the Ordinary Oils I was using. Also seems to help hydrate better (Unless it’s the Amino Aloe Cleanser or hyaluronic toner as I started using all three at the same time).\n\nSpeaking specifically to this product it isn’t as heavy as other oils. Absorbs into my skin faster.  I also started putting this in my hair and Wow. My hair is so smooth, shiny and hydrated.  I have wavy hair that is kind of frizzy. It’s heat treated with a flat iron couple times a week because I haven’t made the effort to get the curls more hydrated. This does seem to do that. My hair is a lot curlier when I apply a pump/pump and a half after washing. It can make the hair stick together and look a little oily if you over apply but I find I put extra on during the weekend. Then it doesn’t so much matter and over the span of a day or so it does lose the oiliness (again this is if applying a pump each side of the head. Which is more than is really needed). Half pump each side would likely do without being oily. I will be buying this again even if just for what it does to my hair.', ""Make sure to apply just a little bit because it can be thick, but it's great very hydrating"", 'I have multiple autoimmune diseases that can cause rashes on my face and body. I also have very sensitive and dry skin, so finding a moisturizer that works for me can be a huge challenge. After finding this moisturizer and the Biossance cleansing oil, my skin has improved dramatically (sorry, no before and after shots. I’m writing this after using this product for a while). I had some light red scarring along my cheekbones that went away completely. I also started using this product on my upper arms, where I get rashes as well. I use a prescription lotion for that rash that never completely cleared it up. Using this oil, as well as the cleansing oil, with that prescription lotion is what finally cleared it up. \n\nI have never found a product line that my skin loves as much as Biossance.

Je ne peux plus m'en passer! je l'utilise a la sortie de la douche."", 'This is a very nice light weight oil (on the thin watery side rather than thick oil). With a very light clean scent almost non existent. I love adding a few drops to moisturizer or patting on my face alone after cleansing :)', 'I don’t have incredibly dry skin to the point where it’s irritated, flakey or itchy but I do have combo/dry skin. This product is super perfect for my skin because it’s not a heavy oil and does not feel too greasy, it absorbs well instead of just sitting on my skin. It smells like hemp, it is lightweight and a little goes a long way! I personally really like it. I usually apply oils as the last part of my night skincare routine or mix a drop with my moisturizer. I like it! If you want to “splurge” on a product, go for this one.', ""Love this oil for the summertime when all other face oils run too thick. It's fragrance-free, but with the hemp oil, it's got a natural, pleasant scent. I don't use more than a few drops a day, and it moisturizes dry spots without irritating areas prone to breakouts. Definitely recommend!"", 'I have a skin picking problem, any blemish I see I need to mess with it and my face looks red and covered in sores after. This oil calms my face down within minutes! It definitely helped healing my face as well, normally I use a regular ointment. If you’re worried about this being an “oil” , it’s non greasy and sinks into my skin quickly. It was more of an impulse buy for me but I’m just genuinely so amazed by the quality of this product.  If you are looking for something to comfort your face you definitely need to give this a try.', 'I absolutely loved this oil. I have eczematic skin, and found this so calming, as well as super hydrating for my overly dry skin. \nHowever, the reason i’ve rated it 3 stars is due to the packaging. I’ve purchased 2 bottles, and with both, the dropper disintegrated before I even finished half the bottle. It ended up being a huge waste of product, and very disappointing', 'A small amount goes a long way. Fabulous overnight - skin feels so soft in the AM.', 'This oil is amazing for sensitive or dry skin skin. I been using this  product for about a year and I been going getting amazing results like my skin is so smooth and glowing after using this oil. I love it and truly would keep buying it.', 'I used it for one night on my very irritated red spot on my face where the mask touches, and I was Pleasantly surprised on the next morning to see that red spot was healed and not itchy anymore!! \nI had to mention though, that this is super strong!  I had some spill over oil on my right palm (a very big dog almost knocked the bottle over the table) and I forgot to wipe off... next morning my entire right palm skin came off!! It’s only a thin layer and made my skin plump, but it scared me a bit. So please remember to use a tiny bit at a time!! For whole face, I use three drops and I have a huge face. For a spot treatment, a smallest drop at a time!! \nI have sensitive skin, and spring and summer I’ll have allergy hives and redness on my cheeks and forehead. I also have eczema on my hands and arms due to hand sanitizer/excessive hand washing during covid. This oil helps calming those allergy and eczema itchiness and redness. I also noticed my skin is generally more moisturized after few days of using twice a day, morning and night.', 'I was skeptical of this but it’s worked wonders on my rosacea. Better than Dr. Jart cica!', ""I've always been worried about trying a facial oil, but I was looking for a serum that would help even out the redness in my face while providing hydration. I absolutely love this serum! A little goes a long way, and I love using it at nighttime and letting it sit a bit before adding my night moisturizer."", 'I use this dry oil whenever my skin is feeling stressed out.  I love using it after a work out because it immediately helps to chill my skin and reduce redness.  I love letting it set in a bit before applying my day time moisturizer and make up.', 'I have acne prone dry skin. I used oil free products for years, no acne, but very dry skin. Then I got a trial size of this oil and I was afraid to try it. Once I did, I discovered my skin has been in need of a good oil! I add it before my moisturizer and keeps my skin soft! No acne! It has helped me so much with mask wearing irritation. It’s soothing for the skin and the natural scent also soothes my soul. It’s a must have for me. I also use it as a primer before foundation when using a matte foundation. Very versatile product.', 'This formulation feels so good to put on. It’s not heavy of an oil and makes your skin feel nourished! I can wear this during the day with makeup and at night. Best oil I’ve ever tried by far, and the price isn’t that bad.', 'Love how calming this product was for my skin! I also love how the oil isn’t super heavy and it works perfectly for me under makeup in the winter months when I get dry patches. I’ve repurchased 3 times because I love it so much.']"

Helps repair moisture barrier. Have used for about 3 years and never want to be without.', 'I tried this in one of the gift sets and it is one of the best Origin products in my opinion. I have acne prone oily skin and this does not cause pimples or grease, it makes my skin so hydrated and radiate, not shiny/oily...one of the best essences on the market even better than the pricier ones.\nI pour a little into my palms then pat into my face, kinda like men do with aftershave lol, you got to try this stuff!', 'Love it. I use it as a toner before applying my day cream. It is light and feels awesome.', 'I absolutely love this product and will be purchasing the large bottle! I apply it directly to my face (tilt head back) and rub in with fingers, rather than placing it in my hands (or on a cotton round) then on face because I feel like I am wasting the product. Like others have said, this is a watery consistency and not lotion. I have noticed an improvement with the redness on my cheeks and around my nostrils that nothing else seems to have been able to calm down. My skin drinks this up and it feels so fresh in the morning after sleeping! After rinsing my face with warm water in the morning and then using it, my face looks and feels awake, plump but not swollen. Def recommend!', ""Warning: this is not a lotion. This has the consistency of water and is clear. With that being said I liked this product after all. I see an improvement in my redness and I think my skin's oiliness has improved."", 'I was looking for a toner that didn’t burn, make me splotchy, or make my cheeks even more red. This works. It doesn’t burn or make me splotchy in any way. Best of all, it minimizes/reduces the redness in my cheeks to almost none at all. It’s not sticky. I plan on keeping this as a staple in my facial routine.', ""I'm pretty sure this is a five star product but haven't used long enough yet to say. Instant resultshowever and so far I'm totally impressed. It appears to even out the sun damage on my neck and chest and the ingredients have me feeling I'm doing something wonderful for my skin. Make sure to shake well and use a little pad to apply it runs clear and fast like vodka. Buy it! I will be! Infact, it has me looking more deeply at other products in the same line."", 'I’ve definitely enjoyed adding this product into my routine, it makes my skin very soft and I believe it’s helped my redness after 2 weeks of using it. \nI dislike the liquid consistency but I have gotten use to it and wouldn’t deter me from buying it again.

Terrible. Weird. Disappointing. I’ll def be returning it.', 'I really was surprised by this product. I really liked it, very nourishing and I feel like it brightened my face after I used it. I would get it again', ""I had initially gotten this product in a  sample size, and it was terrible - it left me greasy to the touch. However I decided to buy it a while later because I was too lazy to find out what other moisturizers were vegan. To my surprise, the product I received was much better - it soaks into the skin without leaving a residue and leaves me feeling moisturized all day, which is hard to do in a desert climate. I'm not sure if they reconfigured the formula, but this is the only moisturizer I use now."", 'Thick, goopy consistency. I  applied a thin layer all over face and it feels extremely oily: so much so that it clouded up my eyelashes and had to wash it off to read or look at phone!

I purchased this towards the end of summer and really have been loving it. The moisturizer is very thick and emollient and feels lovely on the skin. I don't use it in the morning because I use a tinted SPF with enough moisturizing ingredients, but I would imagine those with dry skin would love it for the daytime. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy. It does leave a very nice sort of glow to the skin so it could probably even work as a primer. Overall, very satisfied with this product and will continue to buy it."", 'Read this before you buy it please . I have normal skin, a little more on the drier side during winter season. I tried this product,  In my opinion this is one of the worst moisturizer .  its so over rated, I thought vegan milk moisturizer would be more moisturizing however not the case what so ever.  Its so hard to apply it on your skin, because its kinda heavy but not moisturizing at all.  Its probably better for oily skin , still the texture was really thick and dry . Very disappointed !

I absolutely love the smell too.', 'This smells really lovely, and it makes a huge difference in brightening my skin. It has an incredible moisturizing effect and I notice a significant improvement in my red spots after a few hours. I have dry skin and acne hyperpigmentation and it soothes my skin.', 'I have used this for 3 years and nothing performs quite as well. Truly, a little scoop is adequate so I believe you will find it to be a great value. This sleeping facial is like a duvet to protecting your skin especially in harsh winter weather. I would use this during outdoor winter sports but especially at night as a moisturizer + benefits. You will notice after application how it immediately softens your face and in the morning your complexion is brighter and overtime the evening of your tone is noticeable. The texture of the product is like softened butter and is a joy to use. As the other reviews mention it does have a rose sent that is somewhat dated but as you only need a little bit the sent is not too heady and dissipates quickly. When you seek sanctuary from cold, harsh, dry, radiator conditions take refuge here.', ""Look, I love the scent of roses and use a rose-otto moisturizer often. But this has such a strong scent I literally couldn't get to sleep till i washed it off the first night. Unholy levels of scent!

Other setting sprays always left my very dry skin tight and a bit dull after a few hours, and my undereye area couldn't be rehydrated without having to redo my concealer, with fingers crossed I wouldn't make a bigger mess around the eyes and cheekbones.

I don't know why this isn't talked about more.  This didn't irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin and it's got great skincare ingredients (bakuchiol, ceramides).    I find one pump does do the job, and I can apply it to my face and neck, it just isn't as smooth as other moisturizers I have used that also have a thick texture (Belif, Sunday Riley).  It lasted about 2.5 months, which I find to be on par. The downside is the texture + pump.  Its texture is pretty thick - not as emollient as I would like.  I had A LOT of product left at the bottom, so I suggest getting a little scoop to get it out or turning it upside down once you notice it's not dispensing as well.

I only removed one star because of the smell - there is no fragrance adding which is GREAT for skin, but yes, in that case - you get a very mild, almost “sock like” smell lol but it only lasts a few minutes till the lotion absorbs. I can put up with that, because no moisturizer WITH fragrance has ever been kind to my skin.\nI tend to get chemical burns easily as well because I’m in esthetician school and we work on eachother with products I’m not used to - this heals my skin by the next day every time.', 'Amazing Amazing Amazing!! Skin feels so soft, no greasy finish! Very moisturizing but also light - perfect for both winter and summer :))']"

I’ve had great experiences with this brand and was excited to try this moisturizer. I use it every morning and every night.

Smells great and fine mist which I personally prefer. I have combo skin oily on the T-zone, but I still enjoyed.', 'The best setting spray! Smells delicious, does improve makeup staying power and has the best spray nozzle- it sprays incredibly fine so you don’t have big liquid droplets ruining your hard work. I think it even helps eye makeup last longer. It is rare for me to have a staple for a particular beauty category but this is definitely the only setting spray I’ll use. Blows Urban Decay out of the water.', 'Super fine and even most, dewy but not glittery or wet look which I LOVE. It dried well and my makeup lasted through the day, 10/10 for a summer time makeup setter. Also the smell is great!', 'I’m so confused and bummed by this product. I purchased the smaller size to try it before committing to the full size, and I’m glad I did. I cannot stand the smell!! Also, I was looking for a setting spray that would hopefully add some type of glow/luminosity or at least help me look a little less matte; this did nothing. Wouldn’t recommend.', 'THE BEST setting spray there is!!! It’s so under-hyped (which I’m kind of okay with because then it will always be in stock lol) but truly I don’t know how people aren’t raving about this!

I loooove the way it smells, I love the light mist, and I love the way it keeps my make up in place and my skin looking hydrated! 10/10 for me!', ""Great Product! I've tried everything under the Sephora sun (previous employee). I purchased this one online because I remember it smelled amazing and had a nice misting spray pump. I generally trust Glam Glow to have a solid product. It does not disappoint. You do not need a lot of this even though it is a super fine mist. Fun packaging like all of GG, and worth the money because it has lasted 7 months and I still have a 1/4 bottle left! It does the job, keeps your makeup on and makes you look fabulous! Five Star product!"", ""I don't know why more people don't seem to know about this product. This is an amazing setting spray. First of all, it smells great. It leaves the skin SO dewy and healthy looking. I think this would work for almost everyone, but if you're oily, just avoid the t zone. Also, the spray itself comes out as such a fine mist - no big water droplets to mess anything up. Honestly this is a holy grail for me, I pray it never gets discontinued."", 'After i few hours my makeup was sliding off. I wouldn’t buy it if you have oily skin. It does give you a nice finish before your makeup starts running. 2 to 3 sprays is enough.']"

Not yet sure how helpful it is. All I know is that I saw nothing at first, but did see a gradual build up benefit."", ""Review based on free sample.

The uber thick pudding texture is off-putting and it doesn't absorb well - I noticed flaking on my next the next morning from where it hadn't absorbed which was gross.

It just smells fresh and clean. Not like perfume.', 'When I have skin irritation that just won’t go away, switching to algenist always solve the problem. It’s overall calming and offers just the right amount of moisture for my sensitive combination skin. After trying many medium and lower priced moisturizers, I decided to keep my routin simple with rose water and this Algenist cream. (Occasional dab of Origins mushroom toner does wonder in dissolving my skin problems too). The texture is unusual; the first time I tried it yeas ago I was very skeptical, but I’ve come to love it. It feels as if the spongy texture is to keep the cream in a steady state until it melts on the skin into just the right fatty particle size.', ""I've been using this for years now.

I do use SkinCeuticals for the serums, but this on top is magic!', 'I received a sample of this and I was very excited to try it. It smelled nice and the thick, creaminess felt good when applied. Unfortunately it began peeling and flaking off minutes later and my skin was left with a greasy texture. My skin felt worse than before I applied it.

It smells kinda like French vanilla ice cream lol but not over powering at all. I personally love it and find it to be light. I use this and the collagen serum as my daytime duo. Highly recommend.', 'Very mediocre product, doesn’t do too much for your skin. Definitely need to use a toner, essence, serum before use or else it just sits on your face because it’s such a thick and heavy cream.

If you’re looking for a good eye cream it is worth it to spend the money on something that will work!', ""I have extremely sensitive under eyes and oily skin, I wanted a basic hydrating eye cream. For the first few days I enjoyed this eye cream, but then I got a reaction. Super dry red flaky skin and my eyelids swelled up. I stopped using it and am on the hunt for something else.

A lovely moisturizer for the eye area that plays well with other products and make up.  The dispenser is genius as it pushes up the last little bit of the content.

I'm super happy with this product! way better than all the others I've tried."", ""It's not worth to buy. This product does nothing for your skin. When it just apply to my face, I felt light and comfortable. But once it dry, it would pills off. The only thing I used underneath is toner."", 'Love it. I have dark circles (hereditary) that I struggle with. Can definitely see a brightening and tightening when using this. Cuts down on the concealer a little bit. :)', 'Found this to be very drying for underneath the eyes. While I’m aware that it isn’t a moisturizer, I didn’t expect that it would actually highlight fine lines and wrinkles, even when used with a moisturizer. The only use I can find for this is above the eye, on the lid, where there’s a slight lifting effect and the drying effect is less noticeable. Under the eye - big no- way too drying for mature eyes, or those with dry skin.  Probably best for those with minimal eye issues, just looking for something to help reduce puffiness a bit.', ""It doesn't feel very nice under my eyes. My skin gets very tight feeling and putting moisturizer on top of it is difficult without making a mess."", 'The eye lift does make lift the lid but not sure if I would purchase again.  The product does leave a flaky film that makes eyeshadow look bumpy.  I have tried applying it carefully to make sure it is evenly applied, but there still leaves a little film on the lid.  Decided to put up with the flakes since it does lift the lid.', ""I went into Sephora looking for a new eye cream. Although, I was liking what I was using in the morning I just wanted to see what else was out there. I was making my way through the aisles and I was greeted by whom I believe to be a REN representative who continued to tell me about the product line, etc. I told her of my concerns and she introduced this product to me. I tried it on in store and loved the instant brightening effect. I decided to purchase it during the VIB sale. So the first time trying it on my own I did notice the splotchy white cast that I see other reviewers mentioning, but I learned that it was due too using too much product. I now do less than 1/2 a pump on days that I know will be dragging on forever. I have now started to place my regular eye cream first and then adding a little bit of this on top. I typically do not wear makeup to work and applying this product gives me the bright/awake concealer effect. Also, after a long day I have noticed that it doesn't even settle into any of my fine lines like some other 'brightening' eye creams have in the past. I knocked a star off because it does take time to learn how to apply it correctly and the REN rep was kind of relentless as she started to bad mouth other brands in the store (including some of my holy grail brands) and towards the end of the conversation I learned it was because REN was being taken out of the store, however I'm not sure if she meant all of Sephora or just that 1 branch. Regardless this item is awesome and def worth purchasing!"", 'Been using it for few months now. Have not noticed changes to dark circles and fine lines, but it is definitely moisturizing and kind to sensitive skin.', ""Amazing product. Works really well to smooth and depuff eyes. Container is pretty small and it's hard to control how much comes out. I always ended up with too much and felt like I was wasting it. I just use regular Ren Beauty Shot now."", 'I tried to take a good photo to show how it turns white and flakey approximately an hour after application. I wanted to like this product so much but clearly it’s not good. I have tried it 5 times now and read that if you moisturize your skin first, that this won’t happen. It still flaked. You should not have to moisturize before application in the first place. I have never had a product do this before. It was a waste of money unfortunately.']"

I had dark discoloration, so bad it sometimes turned my concealer grey-ish :( I think gentle massaging with this really helps too!', 'My first impression was that the texture is heavenly- it feels so nourishing on your eyes. The scent is so light and not disruptive. My eye area looks brighter since using it and it moisturizer very well. I don’t have issues with firmness or wrinkles so I can’t comment on that but I want to prevent.

I may transition to this one long-term.', ""Way better than expected. Best eye cream I've tried"", 'Very intense moisturizing properties without being too greasy. Perfect for following up with an infrared light too.', 'Lovely non-irritating cream. Soothing and moisturizing but in the lighter side. I like creams that soak in and feel natural, if you like a richer consistency this may be too light for you. For me it’s a keeper and I’ve enjoyed using it nightly.', 'I received this as a free sample and was excited to try it out because I live Biossance products.

However, it doesn’t do much for dark circles and puffiness.', 'I had high hopes for this product dealing with dark circles under my eyes due to lack of sleep.

I use tretinoin and like to apply this eye cream first to prevent the tretinoin from migrating too close to my eyes and keep my under eyes nice and hydrated through the night. It’s pretty thick, but it works for day time use under my tinted sunscreen as well. I think it helps to plump up my skin and may even be helping with the appearance of my dark circles. I will definitely repurchase this!', ""This eye cream is incredibly moisturizing! I am really really obsessed with how nice it is. I have very sensitive eyes and it doesn't irritate me like some other eye creams have. I also use on my eyelids. After a month of use, I have realized this is best as a night eye cream or no makeup eye cream, as it did seem to make my under eye concealer and eyeshadow crease like crazy.
